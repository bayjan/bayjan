- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bayjan
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using machine learning algorithms to find patterns from data, especially, biomedical multi-omics data. 
  - Iâ€™m interested in comparative genomics analysis and do irregular DevOps tasks as well.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a deep learning framework and its application to several data types.
